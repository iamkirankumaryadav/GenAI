# **Basics of AI**

### **Standalone AI Tools**
- AI powered software designed to work independently with minimal setup.
- Can be directly accessed through the websites or applications.
- Without integration with other software or any dependency on any module or library.
- Example: Chat GPT, Gemini, Claude, Perplexity, Midjourney, and other AI tools in the market.

### **Tools with integrated AI Features**
- Built in AI enhancements within a particular piece of software.
- Example: Gemini Integrated with Google Workspace Applications (Docs, Sheets, Slides, Drive, Meet, Drive, Gmail, etc.)
- Meta AI (Llama 3.1) integrated with WhatsApp, Facebook and other applications.
- Chat GPT integrated with Microsoft Copilot.

### **Custom AI Solution**
- An application that's tailor-made to solve a specific problem.

### **Chain of Thoughts**
- When you divide a single task into more manageable steps, you help the LLM to produce accurate and consistent results.

### **Zero Shot Prompting**
- No examples included in your prompt.
- Example: "Explain me about FOSFOR"

### **One Shot Prompting**
- One example included in your prompt.
- Example: "Explain me about FOSFOR. Take a reference from Google, I'm asking about one product"

### **Few Shot Prompting**
- 2 or more examples included in your prompt.
- Example: "Explain me about FOSFOR. Take a reference from Google, I'm asking about a product, you can also use fosfor.com"

### **Limitation of AI**
- The underlying data that is used to train AI models may be biased.
- Not enough information in the source training data on a given topic.
- Hallucinations are AI outputs that are just factually inaccurate.
