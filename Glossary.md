- Risks of ASI: Existential threat, unforseen consequences (actions we can't predict), job displacement.

### **Bots**
- Bots are automated programs that perform specific tasks over a network.
- They can be very simple or complex, but their core function is to automate repetitive actions.
- Examples: Weather bots that automatically update forecasts, or social media bots that follow specific accounts.

### **Chatbots**
- Chatbots are a specific type of bot designed for simple, rule based system conversation with pre-defined responses.
- They use NLP and ML to understand and respond to user input/queries in a chat-like interface.
- Chatbots can be used for customer service, answering FAQs, scheduling appointments, or even providing entertainment.
- Example: WhatsApp Meta AI, Google Chat Gemini, or Career Website Chatbots.

### ChatGPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformers)
- ChatGPT leverages large language models (LLMs) to allow users to have human-like interactions.
- ChatGPT is trained to hold conversations that flow and adapt based on user input/queries/prompts.
- It can consider previous prompts (history) and replies to maintain context within a conversation.
- You can specify the length, format, style, and level of detail you prefer for the responses.
- Generates human-quality text, translate languages, write different kinds of creative content, and answer questions.
- Have engaging conversation, brainstorm ideas, compose emails, poems, articles, letters, codes, scripts, music, etc.
- ChatGPT is a powerful tool for conversation, creative exploration, and information gathering.
- GPT models are based on the transformer architecture, which allows them to efficiently process and generate human-like text by learning from vast amounts of data.
- The pre-trained aspect refers to the initial extensive training these models undergo on large text corpora, allowing them to understand and predict language patterns.
- This pre-training equips the GPT models with a broad understanding of language, context, and aspects of world knowledge.

### **Completions**

- Completions are the output produced by AI in response to a given input or prompt.
- When a user inputs a prompt, the AI model processes it and generates text that logically follows or completes the given input.
- Completions are based on the patterns, structures, and information the model has learned during its training phase on vast datasets.

### **Conversational AI**
- AI that can simulate conversation with humans using NLP.
- Enables computers to understand and respond to spoken or written language in a way that feels natural and engaging for users.
- NLP allows computers to interpret the meaning behind human language, including factors like context, slang, and sarcasm.
- Customer service chatbots: Troubleshoot problems, 24/7 service. Virtual assistance (Alexa, Siri, Google). Companion Chatbots.

### **Embeddings**
- Embeddings are a powerful tool for representing text data in a way that machines can understand and manipulate.
- Raw text data is difficult for machines to process directly.
- Embeddings transforms text into a numerical representation. Condense text into a series of numbers that capture meanings.
- They are carefully crafted to capture the semantic meaning of the text. Words with similar meanings will have similar embeddings.
- Allowing the model to understand the relationships between words and concepts.
- Embeddings represent text in a lower-dimensional space compared to the original data.
- This makes it more efficient for AI models to process and analyze large amounts of text data.
- Embeddings helps in search and retrieval, searching for information within a vast collection of documents.
- Embeddings can find documents with similar meaning to your query, even if they don't use the exact same words.
- Embeddings can identify the most important parts of a text document and generate concise summaries that capture the key points.
- Embeddings helps to understand the intent behind a user's question and respond in a relevant and informative way.
- By converting text to a more manageable format, embeddings allow GenAI models to work faster and analyze larger datasets.
- Lower-dimensional embeddings require less storage space compared to raw text data.

### **Few Shot Learning**
- A concept where the model is designed to learn and make accurate predictions or decisions based on a very limited amount of training data.
- Traditional machine learning models typically require large datasets to learn effectively.
- Few-shot learning techniques enable AI models to generalize from a small number of examples, often just a handful or even a single instance.
- This approach is especially valuable in situations where collecting large datasets is impractical or impossible, such as specialized academic fields or rare languages.

### **Fine Tuning**
- The process of taking a pre-trained AI model and further training it on a specific, often smaller, dataset to adapt it to particular tasks or requirements.
- This is relevant in scenarios where a general AI model, trained on varied datasets, needs to be specialized or optimized for specific applications.

### **Generative AI** 
- AI systems that can generate new content—such as texts, images, audio, and video—in response to prompts by a user.
- After being trained on an earlier set of data.
- Text: ChatGPT, Gemini, Meta AI.
- Image: DALL E, Ideogram, Midjourney.
- Video: Sora

### **Hallucinations** 
- Incorrect or misleading results that AI models generate.
- These errors can be caused by a variety of factors, including insufficient training data, incorrect assumptions made by the model, or biases in the data used to train the model.
- The concept of AI hallucinations underscores the need for critical evaluation and verification of AI-generated information.

### **Inference** 
- The process where a trained AI model applies its learned knowledge to new, unseen data to make predictions, decisions, or generate content.
- It is essentially the phase where the AI model, after being trained on a large dataset, is now being used in real-world applications.
- Unlike the training phase, where the model is learning from examples, during inference, the model is utilizing its learned patterns to perform the specific tasks it was designed for.
- Example: A language model that has been trained on a vast corpus of text can perform inference by generating a new essay, answering a student’s query, or summarizing a research article.

### **Large Language Models (LLMs)** 
- AI systems specifically designed to understand, generate, and interact with human language on a large scale.
- These models are trained on enormous datasets comprising a wide range of text sources, enabling them to grasp the complexities, and varied contexts of natural language.
- LLMs like GPT use particularly transformer architectures, to process and predict text sequences.

### Model:
- Models are the algorithms that enable Generative AI to process data, learn patterns, and perform tasks such as generating text, images, or making decisions.
- Essentially, it is the core framework that embodies an AI’s learned knowledge and capabilities.
- A model in AI is created through a process called training, where it is fed large amounts of data and learns to recognize patterns, make predictions, or generate outputs based on that data.
- Each model has its specific architecture and parameters, which define its abilities and limitations.

### **Natural Language Programming (NLP)**

- NLP is a field at the intersection of computer science, AI, and linguistics.
- Focused on enabling computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language in a way that is both meaningful and useful.
- The development of algorithms that can analyze, comprehend, and respond to text or voice data in a manner similar to how humans do.
