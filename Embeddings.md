# **What is an embedding?**
- A way of representing data as points in space where the locations are semantically meaningful
- It alos understands the context with the help of surrounding words.
- e.g. "Penguins are running behind the seal", "Eagles are flying very low today", "Dog is not feeling well".
- While reading the data model will understand the context and put everything in the category of Birds and Animals.
- Modern embedding compute embeddings for each token rather than entire word to understand the context.
