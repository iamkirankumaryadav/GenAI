# Introduction to Generative AI `(GenAI)`

- `GenAI` is a type of AI technology that can produce various types of content, including text, image, audio, video and synthetic data.

![What is GenAI?](https://github.com/iamkirankumaryadav/GenAI/blob/4293302634c4cb68c55168829d3c9e175daa23fa/Image/What%20is%20Gen%20AI.png)

### `Artificial Intelligence`
- `AI` is a branch of computer science that deals with the creation of intelligent agents, that are systems that can reason, learn and act autonomously.
- `AI` build machines that think and act like humans.

### `Machine Learning`
- `ML` is a program or system that trains a model from input data. Trained model can make useful predictions and classifications from new or never before seen data drawn from the same one used to train the model.
- `ML` gives computers the ability to learn without explicitly programming.
- `Supervised Learning`: Model learns from past examples to predict future values.
- `Unsupervised Learning`: Is all about discovery, learning from patterns.

### `Deep Learning`
- `DL` is a type of ML that uses `ANN's` Artificial Neural Networks, allowing to process more complex patterns than ML.
- ANN's are inspired by human brain.
- They are made up of many interconnected nodes and neurons that can learn to perform tasks by processing data and making predictions.
- Deep learning models have many layers of neurons, which allow them to learn more complex patterns than traditional machine learning models.
- ANN's can use both labeled and unlabeled data (semi supervised learning) A neural network is trained on a small amount of labelled data and a large amount of unlabelled data.
- The labeled data helps the neural network to learn the basic concept of the task, while the unlabeled data helps the neural network to generalize to new examples (new unseen data).

### `Generative Artificial Intelligence`
- GenAI is a subset of DL, which means it uses ANN's that can process both labeled and unlabeled data using supervised, unsupervised and semi supervised methods.

### `Large Language Model (LLM)`
- Large Language Models are also a subset of DL.

### `Discriminative Model`
- Model used to predict and classify labels for data points.
- Discriminative models are trained on data set of labeled data points. And they learn the relationships between the features of the data points and the labels.
- Once a discriminative model is trained, it can be used to predict the label for new data points.

### `Generative Model`
- A generative model generates a new data instances based on a learned probability distribution of existing data.
