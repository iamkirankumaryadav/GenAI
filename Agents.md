# ðŸ¤– Agents

- An agent is a system that can autonomously perform tasks using AI especially LLMs to generate content, make decisions, and interact with other systems or users.

### What makes an Agent in Generative AI?
1. **Perception:** It understands input (text, images, etc.).
2. **Reasoning:** It decides what to do based on goals. Creates a todo list.
3. **Action:** It performs tasks like generating text, calling APIs, or interacting with tools.

### Example: An agent designed to help with travel planning:
- **Input:** "Plan a 3-day trip to Goa"
- **Perception:** Understands the request
- **Reasoning:** Searches for flights, hotels, and activities
- **Action:** Generates an itinerary and books reservations

### This agent might use:
- A language model to understand and generate text
- Tools/APIs to search flights or hotels
- Memory to remember user preferences

## ðŸ¤– Coding Agent
A coding agent helps developers by:
- Reading a bug report
- Understanding the codebase
- Suggesting or writing a fix
- Testing the fix automatically

It combines:
- Code understanding (via LLMs)
- Tool use (e.g., running tests)
- Decision-making (e.g., choosing the best fix)

## ðŸ§© Multi-Agent Systems
Sometimes, multiple agents work together:
- One agent writes code
- Another tests it
- Another documents it
They collaborate like a team of specialists.
